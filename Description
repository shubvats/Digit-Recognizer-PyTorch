Handwritten Digit Recognition with PyTorch

Overview

This repository provides an end-to-end implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is a classic dataset in computer vision, widely used for benchmarking classification algorithms. This project aims to demonstrate fundamental techniques in image classification and serves as a practical introduction to neural networks and deep learning.

Features

Data Handling: Utilizes PyTorch's DataLoader and Dataset classes to efficiently handle and preprocess image data.
Model Architecture: Implements a CNN architecture comprising convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, and fully connected layers.
Training: Trains the model using Adam optimizer with a cross-entropy loss function, employing learning rate scheduling to enhance training efficiency.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance on a validation set and computes classification accuracy metrics.
Inference: Generates predictions on a test set and formats results in a submission-ready CSV file.
